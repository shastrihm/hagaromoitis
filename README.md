# hagaromoitis

A simple agent based simulation of hagaromoitis, a fictional disease that causes people to become obsessed with hagaromo chalk. 

This was a fun instructional simulation I wrote to demonstrate compartmental models for my final presentation in Math 322 : Differential Equations. 

The parameters of the model are explained in the attached writeup.
